    <div class="what-we-do-paragraphs">
        <p>We focus passionately on the detail in every aspect of what we
            do, and learned long ago that great <span id="what-we-do-darken">design</span> can only be realised with
            a great <span id="what-we-do-darken">build</span>. We work with amazing
            architects such as Jimmy J Jamson, Humphrey H Henderson, and 
            Charles C Cockson.
        </p>
        <p>We are able to work with our clients from start to finish, and <span id="what-we-do-darken">beyond</span id="darken">, with
            an architect led design and build service, where design really matters.
            Currently we are helping homeowners and business owners take control of their architectural projects.

    <p>_____________</p>
    <p>"Our project was delivered on time and on budget with few variations
        due to very extensive detailed planning. Puzzle Architect's input
        was always presented in a pragmatic and flexible way, resulting in 
        a relationship where we felt we were all working together to achieve 
        our aspirations. They took the stress out of the design and implementation 
        process, making the whole experience from start to finish both enjoyable 
        and rewarding."

    <h2>Design, Build & Beyond</h2>
    <p id="design">
        Puzzle is driven by design, and led by a team of experienced 
        and chartered Architects. We provide a passionate and sensitive 
        approach to all our projects, by working closely with clients, 
        planning authorities, and contractors alike. We can actively deal 
        with challenging design briefs and projects in complex planning 
        environments. Our goal is to uncover the full potential of your brief, 
        and to seek the unique opportunities that exist within it. We are one of 
        small handful of RIBA Chartered design and build companies in the country.

    <p id="build">
        Bringing a creative vision to life, is a creative act in its
        own right. We've learned to master this challenge, not only by 
        building an extended network of trusted partners, but also by building
        our own internal team of crafts and tradesmen. Our project and
        construction managers therefore operate more like composers,
        orchestrating a familiar and experienced team of experts, and
        enabling that essential synergy between ideas and reality. We have a 
        strong delivery record spanning over the past decade

    <p id="beyond">
         At the beginning. Throughout. And after. When we say beyond,
         we mean in all respects. It's having a dedicated project manager 
         that ties everything and everyone together; It's utilising the 
         latest technologies and platforms to ensure smooth project running; 
         it's making new technologies and platforms of our own, designed to 
         make everything easier for you, at all stages, and in all respects. 
         We are one of the only practices that we know of that's developing 
         its own technology platform, in order to address industry and 
         customer frictions.
